## Who am I?

<img src="/images/zx-spectrum.jpg" alt="ZX Spectrum" class="listImage"/>

This blog is a reflection of my journey as a developer, where I will share my experiences, projects, and insights about
the tech world.

My interest in programming sparked around 1990 when, at the age of 8, I received my first computer, a ZX Spectrum.
Throughout my education as an electronics engineer, I honed my programming skills using Delphi and .NET Visual Basic.

In 2000, I began my career as a senior support engineer for UPC, a prominent internet provider. Here, I developed
support tools and provided business intelligence solutions using Crystal Reports.

From 2004 to 2014, I served as a building manager for Congress and Concert Hall de Doelen. In this role, I oversaw
various technical infrastructure projects.

Since 2014, I have been working as a software developer, initially as a full-stack developer and later transitioning
into a DevOps engineer.
