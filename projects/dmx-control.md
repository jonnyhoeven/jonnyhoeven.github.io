title: Open DMX control
description: A salvaged project aimed to develop userControls for OPEN DMX usb nodes in Visual Studio.Net.
    With form designer it's pretty easy to drag and drop customized layouts. I eventually decided for a different hardware
    device platform featuring better specs. Networking and DMX mixing has not been implemented.
