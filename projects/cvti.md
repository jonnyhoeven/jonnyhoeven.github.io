The touch-sensitive screen in combination with the software CVTI provides control and playback options for the room
cameras and allows for the execution of different control screens for room lighting with a code. With the help of the
management tab, you can restart the computers of the touch-sensitive screens, the lighting & blinds control computer 
"server," and the room camera. Do not be afraid to operate these screens, as dangerous functions are executed with a
technical password. The actual lighting & blinds control computer remains active even if the computer of the
touch-sensitive screen you are using freezes. If a lighting technician uses the professional light table for a
performance, they usually deactivate the lighting control of the lighting & blinds control computer backstage. You truly
cannot make mistakes; if this were to happen unexpectedly, we as technicians are responsible and are of course willing
to promptly resolve any issues based on your feedback.
