title: Augmented Reality Mobile Game
description: An augmented reality mobile game for Android that uses Vuforia to track images and
    display 3D models on top of them. This is a simple demonstration of gaming elements using augmented reality
    features found in the Vuforia imaging SDK used in combination with the Unity game engine. Objective of the game
    is to collect the dropped logo's by tapping the screen while the character pathfinds it's way to your tapping
    Location. Fixes 3D models to Vuforia Marker0.png (included). Just start the app and make sure the marker is visible.
