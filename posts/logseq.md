Logseq's Whiteboard feature lets you organize your knowledge and ideas using a spatial canvas with shapes
, drawings, website embeds, and connectors. You can visually group and link your notes and
external media (such as videos and images), enabling visual thinkers to compose, remix, annotate, and
connect content from their knowledge base and emerging thoughts in a new way.

In addition to its core features, Logseq has a growing ecosystem of plugins and themes that enable a wide range
of workflows and customization options. Mobile apps are also available, providing access to most of the features
of the desktop application. Whether you're a student, a professional, or anyone who values a clear and organized
approach to managing your ideas and notes, Logseq is an excellent choice for anyone looking to improve their
productivity and streamline their workflow.
